# Poo-game

The official name of the game is Poo Boy

Move around in two dimensions to jump and bounce on top 
of hostile "poo" to eliminate them, earn points and stay
alive. 

Chaining together multiple eliminations
will result in an increasing score multiplier the greater
the chain size.

The higher the poo is the more score you will receive 
from eliminating them.

As time goes on the game will get harder.

HAVE FUN!
